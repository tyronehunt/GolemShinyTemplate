# GolemShinyTemplate

<!-- badges: start -->

[![Lifecycle:
experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of GolemShinyTemplate is to learn how to use Golem for creating
a production ready Shiny app. Most of the code in this package is copied
from <https://github.com/ColinFay/tidytuesday201942>, but was built from
the ground up in order to explore which components could be removed and
wherever possible remove complexity.

The final product can be found at:
<https://tyronehunt.shinyapps.io/GolemShinyTemplate/>
