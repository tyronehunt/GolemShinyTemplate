# GolemShinyTemplate

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of GolemShinyTemplate is to learn how to use Golem for creating a production ready Shiny app. Most of the code in this package is copied from https://github.com/ColinFay/tidytuesday201942, but was built from the ground up in order to explore which components could be removed and wherever possible remove complexity.

The final product can be found at: https://tyronehunt.shinyapps.io/GolemShinyTemplate/
